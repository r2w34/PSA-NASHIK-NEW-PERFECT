## üîß CRITICAL MISSING FUNCTIONALITY

### High Priority Issues
1. **API Integration**: Most forms log to console instead of making actual API calls
2. **Real-time Updates**: Data doesn't refresh after operations
3. **Error Handling**: Need proper error messages and validation feedback
4. **Loading States**: Need loading spinners during operations
5. **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for user feedback

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Search Functionality**: Global search in header needs implementation
2. **Dark Mode**: Toggle exists but functionality needs completion
3. **Notifications**: Bell icon in header needs implementation
4. **User Profile**: Profile dropdown needs full implementation
5. **Export Features**: Export buttons need actual functionality
6. **Pagination**: Large data sets need pagination
7. **Sorting**: Table columns need sorting functionality
8. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple items for bulk actions

### Low Priority Issues
1. **Advanced Filters**: More sophisticated filtering options
2. **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs need enhancement
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Some components need mobile improvements
4. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Performance**: Code splitting and lazy loading
